## History

Semaeopus was founded in early 2014 by Rich Metson and Pontus Schönberg, and has since grown into a team of 10+ passionate developers and creators. United by a desire to push the boundaries of the medium, the team is driven not just by fun and creativity, but by a commitment to making games that help the industry grow and evolve.

In addition to offering design and development services, Semaeopus is currently working on _Off Grid_—a stealth hacking game that marks the studio’s debut original IP.
